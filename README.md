# openReddit

An open source Reddit app written in Flutter.

## Disclaimer
This is one of my first Flutter apps so the code quality is not that good and there are
many best practices that were ignored :( I started a rewrite here: https://github.com/ThatsEli/reddsource

## Why?

There are many Reddit apps already out there. But none of these apps satisfied
all of my needs or was open source so I could add feautures to them. Due to this I started 
developing this app. It was originally just intended to help me learn Dart/Flutter. 
~~But now I use it everyday~~ and thougt, why not release it. So, here it is! 
Please keep in mind, that I am relatively new to Flutter/Dart so there could
be some beginner error. I am always open to tips and improovments!

## I have a problem

Just create an Github issue describing the problem. If you are a developer, if
possible attach a stack trace or/and error message. An example project or file
is always nice to have fto fix your problem as fast as possible.

## How to contribute

You fixed an bug? Or just added an feauture? Just create a PR with a description
about what you added/changed. Make sure, that the design fits the rest of the
app and have fun :) There will be tests implemented later.

## Special thanks
